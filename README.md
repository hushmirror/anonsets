This repo contains a whitepaper about the Anonymity Sets of Privacy coins, in particular of Zcash Protocol coins, where they are specifically called Shieled Pools.

# Definition of Anonymity Set (anonset)

The idea of anonymity set is actually something simple, with a complex name. If you are playing "Where's Waldo", the anonset is the number of people Waldo is hiding amongst. Mathematically, the larger the number of people, the less chance of picking at random and choosing correctly.

To be more precise, if there are `N` people that Waldo is hiding amongst, there is a `1/N` chance of randomly choosing him in the group of people. When `N=1` there is nobody to hide amongst and there is 100% chance. When `N=100`, there is a 1% chance, and as `N` increases, the chance of randomly choosing the correct person goes to zero.
